## Usage
After installation, the add-on can be accessed in multiple ways.
Selecting any option will open a dialog to process all notes currently selected. 
First you should set a dictionary and a note configuration, after pressing `Start` notes will be updated.
To access the dialog, choose one of the following options on browser menu:

- `å®š` button inside note editor.
- `Add definition` action in edit menu or right-click context menu.

### 1. Select a dictionary

At top-right of the dialog there's a `Browse` button that will let you select a *zip* file containing the dictionary entries.
To check if a dictionary was properly imported, use the `Preview` tab to search a word definition.

There are three text formats to choose from:
- `HTML-Full`: keep all html.
- `HTML-Brief`: keep only list elements, discard styles. 
- `Plain-Text`: format list elements to plain text.
