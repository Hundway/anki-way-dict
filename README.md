## Usage
After installation, the add-on can be accessed in multiple ways.
Selecting any option will open a dialog to process all notes currently selected. 
First, you should set a dictionary and a note configuration; after pressing `Start`, notes will be updated.
To access the dialog, choose one of the following options on the browser menu:

- `å®š` button inside note editor.
- `Add definition` action in edit menu or right-click context menu.

### 1. Select a dictionary

At the top-right of the dialog, there's a `Browse` button that will let you select a *zip* file containing the dictionary entries.
To check if a dictionary was properly imported, use the `Preview` tab to search a word definition.

There are three text formats to choose from:
- `HTML-Full`: keep all HTML.
- `HTML-Brief`: keep only list elements, discard styles. 
- `Plain-Text`: format list elements to plain text.

### 2. Set note options

Given a selection of notes, definitions will only be added on those that match the given note configuration:

- `Note type`: target note type.
- `Source field`: field with the word to be searched.
- `Destination field`: field in which definitions will be added.
- `Overwrite destination`: overwrite destination even if it has content.
